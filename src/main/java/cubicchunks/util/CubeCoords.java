/**
 * Position of a cube.
 * <p>
 * Tall Worlds uses a column coordinate system (which is really just a cube coordinate system without the y-coordinate), a cube coordinate system, and two block coordinate systems, a cube-relative system, and a world absolute system.
 * <p>
 * It is important that the systems are kept separate. This class should be used whenever a cube coordinate is passed along, so that it is clear that cube coordinates are being used, and not block coordinates.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, I (Nick) like to use xRel, yRel, and zRel for the relative position of a block inside of a cube. In world space, I (Nick) refer to the coordinates as xAbs, yAbs, and zAbs.
 * <p>
 * See {@link AddressTools} for details of hashing the cube coordinates for keys and storage.
 * <p>
 * This class also contains some helper methods to switch from/to block coordinates.
